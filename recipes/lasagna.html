      <li>1 cup of sliced black olives</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of warm water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of dried onion flakes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of dried sage</li>
      <li>1 pinch of dry basil</li>
      <li>2 (14 ounce) jars of marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package of lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>8 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 pound of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet on medium-high
        heat until brown and crumbled
      </li>
      <li>Drain excess grease, then stir in olives and water</li>
      <li>
        Season the mixture with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic
        powder, pepper, sage, and basil
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the mixture, stirring frequently for about 15 minutes; then stir
        in marinara sauce and remove from the heat
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C)</li>
      <li>
        Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9&times;13 inch
        baking dish, then cover with a layer of noodles. Spread a thin layer of
        ricotta over it before sprinkling with some mozzarella
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with another layer of marinara sauce, then repeat layering, ending
        with meat sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the pre-heated over for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes.
        You'll know that it's cooked when you can easily pierce it with a knife
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the reserved mozzarella cheese over the lasagna, then bake
        until the added cheese melts&mdash;this should take about 10 minutes
      </li>
    </ol>
