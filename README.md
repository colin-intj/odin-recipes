# Odin Recipes

This website is a my first project for The Odin Project's Foundations course; it
showcases three recipes I found online via [www.allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

I chose recipes for each of the three meals&mdash;breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively.
Besides the recipes themselves, I've also included images of the dish and brief
descriptions of the recipes.
